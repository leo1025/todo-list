# ToDo List App
Simple ToDo List App with limited functionality

Following tutorials to learn backend functionality with EJS and Node. The app uses simple files and is a quick introduction to EJS Templates and Layouts, Node.js, Express and Body Parser. Also some Node Module Exports for `date.js`.

## How to use

To run, clone repo and ensure you have Nodemon installed.

`npm install`

`nodemon app.js`

Go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Additional pages

There are 2 other pages but do not have UI navigation. To access them go to:

`http://localhost:3000/about`

and

`http://localhost:3000/work`


## Personal Notes
- This app is a good introductory step to creating more complex projects.
- I have an idea of creating a more robust full scale app for a customizable ToDo List. Perhaps built with React.
- Should that app be offline or online? Should it be an app that can be downloaded like a standalone app?
